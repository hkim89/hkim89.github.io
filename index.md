## About


I am Mathematical Statistician (visiting scientist) in the Division of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics at the National Center for Toxicological Research ([NCTR](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/office-chief-scientist/national-center-toxicological-research)), one of the branches of US Food and Drug Adminitration ([FDA](https://fda.gov)).  My research interest centers on high-dimensional analysis for large-scale data using optimization
techniques in quantitative genetics and genomics, and stochastic processes, and its modelling in economics and insurance.  

I had two postdoctoral research in the Division of [Biostatistics](https://www.uthsc.edu/preventive-medicine/biostatistics.php) in the department of Preventive Medicine at the University 
of Tennessee Health Science Center ([UTHSC](https://uthsc.edu)) and in the [Center for Statistical Genetics](http://statgen.us/Main_Page), followed by the [Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center](https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/research/research-programs-and-partners/gertrude-h-sergievsky-center) at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center ([CUIMC](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu)).    I developed a Julia software package, [FlxQTL](https://github.com/senresearch/FlxQTL.jl), of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis for multivariate linear mixed models at UTHSC.  I have been developing Julia software package of fine mapping for binary traits in Human Genetics to extend the Sum of Single Effects model ([SuSiE](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssb.12388)) as well as QTL mapping to generalized linear mixed models by an empirical Bayes method at CUIMC.  

I had been awarded a master's degree in 
[Applied Mathematics](https://math.unm.edu/) at the University of New Mexico and then a PhD degree in [Statistics](https://statistics.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona.  Under the guidance of Dr. [Stanly Steinberg](https://math.unm.edu/~stanly/), my master's thesis was on understanding the pricing of financial derivatives and numerical methods for solving PDEs. 
The PhD dissertation was on ruin problems in Economics and Insurance under the guidance of 
Dr. [Rabi Bhattacharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_Bhattacharya).
