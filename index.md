## About

I am a postdoctoral research scientist in the [Center for Statistical Genetics](http://statgen.us/Main_Page) in the [Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center](https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/research/research-programs-and-partners/gertrude-h-sergievsky-center) at [Columbia University Irving Medical Center](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu).  My research interest is in high-dimensional analysis for large-scale data using optimization
techniques in quantitative genetics and genomics, stochastic processes, and its modelling. I am currently working closely with Dr. [Gao Wang](https://www.tigerwang.org) and am directed by Dr. [Suzanne Leal](http://statgen.us/Suzanne_M_Leal_PhD) to develop a fine mapping tool for binary traits in Human Genetics to extend the Sum of Single Effects model ([SuSiE](https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12388)) to generalized linear mixed model by an empirical Bayes method.

I developed a Julia software package, [FlxQTL](https://github.com/senresearch/FlxQTL.jl), of QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) analysis under the supervision of Dr. [\'Saunak Sen](http://senresearch.org/) in the Division of [Biostatistics](https://www.uthsc.edu/preventive-medicine/biostatistics.php) 
in the department of Preventive Medicine at the University 
of Tennessee Health Science Center.  

I was granted a PhD degree in [Statistics](https://statistics.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona under the guidance of 
Dr. [Rabi Bhattacharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_Bhattacharya) and worked on ruin problems in Economics and Insurance. 
Under the guidance of Dr. [Stanly Steinberg](https://math.unm.edu/~stanly/), I had been awarded a master's degree in 
[Applied Mathematics](https://math.unm.edu/) at the University of New Mexico. My master's thesis was on understanding the pricing of 
financial derivatives and numerical methods for solving PDEs.
