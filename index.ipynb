Sergievsky Center](https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/research/research-programs-and-partners/gertrude-h-sergievsky-center) at [Columbia University Irving Medical Center](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu).  My research interest is in high-dimensional analysis for large-scale data using optimization\n",

I am currently working closely with Dr. [Gao Wang](https://www.tigerwang.org) and am directed by Dr. [Suzanne Leal](http://statgen.us/Suzanne_M_Leal_PhD) to develop a fine mapping tool for binary traits in Human Genetics to extend the Sum of Single Effects model ([SuSiE](https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12388)) to generalized linear mixed model by an empirical Bayes method.\n",
