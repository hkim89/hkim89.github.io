# Hyeonju Kim

## About

I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Division of [Biostatistics](https://www.uthsc.edu/preventive-medicine/biostatistics.php) 
in the department of Preventive Medicine at the University 
of Tennessee Health Science Center. My research interest is in high-dimensional analysis for large-scale data using optimization
techniques, stochastic processes, and its modelling. I am currently working with Dr. [\'Saunak Sen](http://senresearch.org/) on 
developing an algorithm for multivariate linear mixed models in quantitative genetics and genomics.  

I was granted a PhD degree in [Statistics](https://statistics.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona under the supervision of 
Dr. [Rabi Bhattacharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabi_Bhattacharya) and worked on ruin problems in Economics and Insurance. 
Under the supervision of Dr. [Stanly Steinberg](https://math.unm.edu/~stanly/), I had been awarded a master's degree in 
[Applied Mathematics](https://math.unm.edu/) at the University of New Mexico. My master's thesis was on understanding the pricing of 
financial derivatives and numerical methods for solving PDEs.
